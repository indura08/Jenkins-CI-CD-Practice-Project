Docker is a great way to run Jenkins because it isolates Jenkins in a container. Please keep that in mind

Q: what is the difference between installing jenkins on windows and installing jenkins with docker ? please explain in simpler terms?

A:

1. Installing Jenkins on Windows (Direct Installation)
What it means: You are installing Jenkins directly on your Windows operating system.
How it works:
Jenkins runs like any other app on your computer.
It gets installed on your hard drive, uses your system’s resources (memory, CPU), and stores all its data in folders on your machine (like C:/Program Files/Jenkins).
You’ll manage Jenkins through the Windows operating system.

Pros:
Simplicity: Easy to install if you’re familiar with regular software installations.
No Docker needed: If you're not using Docker for anything else, this can be simpler.

Cons:
Resource Usage: Jenkins runs directly on your system, using your system resources and possibly slowing down your machine.
Messy Uninstallation: If you want to remove it, Jenkins leaves behind files and settings on your machine, which you may have to clean up manually.
Limited Isolation: Any system issues (like misconfigured software or Windows updates) could affect Jenkins.

2. Installing Jenkins with Docker (Containerized Installation)

What it means: You are running Jenkins inside a Docker container, which is like a small, isolated virtual machine.

How it works:
Instead of installing Jenkins directly on Windows, you run it inside a Docker container.
Docker creates a completely isolated environment for Jenkins that doesn’t interfere with your main system.
Jenkins and all its configurations are neatly packaged inside the container, which makes it easy to start, stop, and remove without affecting the rest of your system.

Pros:
Isolation: Jenkins runs in a separate container, so it won’t mess with your Windows system, and your system won’t interfere with Jenkins.
Easy Management: Starting, stopping, or even removing Jenkins is simple with Docker commands. You can easily restart Jenkins without affecting the rest of your system.
Clean Removal: If you no longer need Jenkins, you can remove the entire container and leave no trace behind.
Portability: You can move your Jenkins setup to another machine (as long as Docker is installed) without much hassle.

Cons:
Requires Docker: You need to understand and install Docker first, which is an additional step if you’re not familiar with it.
More Technical: Managing containers may seem a bit more complex if you're new to Docker.
